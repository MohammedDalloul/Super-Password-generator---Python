A password generator coded in python that offers the strongest type of passwords depending on all recognized parameters for passwords' strength.

That program offers a simple GUI where the user can inter their email, the name of the website they are generating the password for, and then press 
    generate password to get their super-strong password generated and shown in the textbox, and then they can press add button to have these info 
    saved in a textfile called "data.txt" and also added to a JSON file "data.json".
    
    The users can also put the website name in the textbox and press search button and that will return them the email and password they have stored
